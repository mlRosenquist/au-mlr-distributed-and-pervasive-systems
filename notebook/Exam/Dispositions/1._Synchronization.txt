====== 1. Synchronization ======

===== Motivation =====
* Challenges of distributed systems 
	* No global clock
* Stock market buy and sell orders
* Need some common notion of real or logicam time -> real/logical clocks

===== Challenges =====
* Logical: chronical local and global event ordering, initial and on-going corrections
* Real: Precise synchronization, clock drift (environmental), on-going corrections

===== Techniques =====

==== Real ====

=== Precision Time Protocol (PTP) ===
* IEEE standard - v2 with improvements
* Synchronize clocks in network - ethernet
* nano second accuracy
* Distributed real-time system
* Method
	* Application layer
	* Timestamp in HW - time stamp unit
	* Phases: Offset Correction, Delay Correction
* Topology
	* Switch with bundary clock
	* Hierarchy

==== Logical ====
* Cronological event ordering accros nodes
* Absence of synch real clocks
* Logical ordering
* Locical clock synchronized

=== Lamport time stamp ===
* Increments counter at lock event
* counter included when sending
* on receive update dependent on current and received
* Happend before relation  e_1 -> e_2 => C(e_1) < C(e_2)
* Clock consistency, contrapositive

=== Vector Clock ===
* Time stamps couldnt tell if a message was concurrent
* Strong clock consistency
* detects causaility vialation unseen by lamport timestamps. necessary (timestamp) and sufficient(vector clocks) causality

===== Perspective =====
* RAFT - replicated logging
