====== 6. Context awareness using smart devices, smart environments and smart interaction (towards intelligent environments) S 9 + 10) ======

===== Litterature =====

==== POSLAD2009 chapter 2 ====
* Calm Technology
201985
	* epower our prephery in three ways
		* engage both the centre of our locus of attention and the prephery of our attention
		* enhance our peripheral reach by brining more details into the perephery
		* offer location awareness when our preiphery is functioning well

==== POSLAD2009 chapter 7 ====
* Context Aware Systems
* Aware of their situation in physical, virtua and user environment. Can adapt this in some way. 
* Environment context: locationm time, person, ict system
* How applications adapt themselves to the context
* Passive the user is presented the context and adapts. Active the system adapts the context for the user. 
* Context presentation, tagging, filtering, based task
* Modelling
	* what the contexts describe and contextexts are, created, composed and used. 
	* Types
		* what,who,where,when,how its accessed and why it is usefu
	* creating and decomposition
		* combing simpler contexts
			* loacation, time, user -> meeting
		* combining homogenous contexts
			* multiple independent sensors
		* combining heterogenous contexts
			* composite
		* derive high context from low
			* time, location -> metting
		* derive low context from high
			* meeting -> time
		* creation, modification, deletion
		* security, privacy
	* Context aware adaption
		* relation of current cotnext to the goal context that is the essence
		* only those that are relevant to goal
	* Context representation
		* 6 types, key value, markup, graphical, Object oriented, logic, ontology
	* Lifecycle: 
		* Context determination
			* compute sensor into data for computation
		* user context acquisition
			* get the goal user context
		* Context processing
			* process and adapt active/passive
		* Context management
			* Store the process
	* Challenges
		* Incomplete, incorrect or imprecise -> false positive and false negatives for user contexts
* Mobility Awareness
	* Location
	* Phone
	* GPS
* Spatial Awareness
	* Location aware system
	* Passitive relative or absolute location
	* Active updated current position and routes on mpas
	* GPS, bluetooth, infrared and wifi
	* Spatation context creation
		* Lateration
			* time of right / RSSI
		* Angulation
			* Angle measurements with at least one known distance
			* aircraft Omi direction raning
		* Coordinate is not enough - need to know what is there for context
* Temporal awareness
	* Coordinating and scheduling
	* Time
	* clock synch
* ICT System awareness
	* transparent 
	* UI
	* UI adaption to context
	* QOS changes when moving
	* Service discovery
	* underlay network aware

* Intelligent Systems (IS)
* IS Architectures
	* Reactive IS Models
	* Environment Model Based IS
	* Goal Based IS
	* Utility Based IS
	* Hybrid IS
	* Knowledge based IS 
* Semantic KB IS
	* Knowledge database 
	* closed world 
	* prolog
* Classical Logic IS
	* Propositional and Predicate Logic
	* Reasoning
* Soft Computing IS Models
	* Probalistics - percentage analysis of context
* IS System Operations
	* Searching
	* Classic Planning

==== AMADOR-DOMINDUEZ2019 paper online ====
* KBs
	* convert unstructured data into knowledge using ontologies.
	* Formal reasoning
	* ML - SV and UV
* Knowledge Graph Embedding
* Planning
	* define protocol, parameters and scope
* Review
	* idenitify which are the fundamental uses of knowledge bases in intelligent environments
* Ambient intelligence 
	* phones
	* social networks as data source
	* smarter sensors - KB makes this data relevant
* Categories - health, housing, education, mobility, risk and resource mgmt., mutidomain and government
	* health - build KB of combination of sensors and medical reports
	* mobility - 
	* risk and resource - 
	* housing - task recognition
		* data by sensors contextualized employing ontolies to create a KB
		* Computer vision
	* Government
		* increased digitalization
		* fuzzy logic rule system
		* citizen query
		* crowdsourced data
	* Education
	* Multidomain
* General 
	* Data generation
		* sensors
		* crowdsourcing
		* reuse existing kbs
	* Contextualization
		* different domain ontologies to generate kbs
* Decision-making and predictive models
	* scalability, interpretability, predictive capability and resource consumption
	* rule-oriented - experts look at kb and define
	* machine learning: neural networks, bayesian regression
		* explain prediction
* Knowledge Graph Embedding for smart Homes
	* Knowledge Graph is a formalization of Knowledge Base
	* Objects are nodes in a graph - edges indicate relations
	* KB in Resource Description framework is a KG where a fact presents existing relathionship
	* Google Assistant built over google knowledge graph
	* smart home for eldercare
	* task recognition - main problem
		* three elemnts compose a fact: subject, relation and object
		* Know two out of three - goal to predict missing element - triple or link prediction
	* Symptom Detection
	* Personal Assistance
		* KG has reminders
		* guding activities
		* brush teeth, needs instrument, toothpase
* Conclusion
	* identified application of kbs to iEnvironment - health and mobility
	* primary data from sensors and citcens, reuse existing kbs
	* Rue-based appraches most up and coming decision-making models
	* Presented models has - High interpretability, low ress consumption, scalability limitation

==== RIBONI2020 paper online ====
* Unsupervised recognition of Multi-Resident activies in smart-homes
* Getting labelled data takes time and affects privacy of recidents
* Introduction
	* state-of-the-art assumes single-reisdent
	* existing multi-resident techniques
		* data associations
		* activity recognition - hidden markov models (ML)
		* supervised learning - privacy, overhead
	* propsoed:
		* weaker form of data association - resident separation - pair of observed sensor events same resident or different
		* Knowledge based reasoning
		* semantic correlation among sensor events
		* OWL 2 ontology
		* Good performance in determining resident and activity
		* no cameras or wearables
* multi-inhabitant activity recognition system
	* sensor installation -> data qcquisition -> resident separation -> activity recognition
	* sensor installation
		* set up
	* data acquisition
		* retrieve data from single resident doing activities
	* resident separation
		* system procces data and build model
		* binary classification - same resident or not
		* temporal proximity - different people
	* activity recognition
		* determine activity
		* get results from resident separation model and stream of sensor events
		* Unsupervised hidden markov model with resident separation
		* Ontology: PreparingHotMeal as an activity that requires the usage of a CookingIstrument
			* detectsUsageOf an instance of Oven which is subclass of CookingUstrument
			* -> cooking hot meal
