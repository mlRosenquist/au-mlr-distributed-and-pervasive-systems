====== 6. Context awareness using smart devices, smart environments and smart interaction (towards intelligent environments S 9 + 10) ======

===== Litterature =====

==== POSLAD2009 chapter 2 ====
* Calm Technology
	* epower our prephery in three ways
		* engage both the centre of our locus of attention and the prephery of our attention
		* enhance our peripheral reach by brining more details into the perephery
		* offer location awareness when our preiphery is functioning well

==== POSLAD2009 chapter 7 ====
* Context Aware Systems
* Aware of their situation in physical, virtua and user environment. Can adapt this in some way. 
* Environment context: locationm time, person, ict system
* How applications adapt themselves to the context
* Passive the user is presented the context and adapts. Active the system adapts the context for the user. 
* Context presentation, tagging, filtering, based task
* Modelling
	* what the contexts describe and contextexts are, created, composed and used. 
	* Types
		* what,who,where,when,how its accessed and why it is usefu
	* creating and decomposition
		* combing simpler contexts
			* loacation, time, user -> meeting
		* combining homogenous contexts
			* multiple independent sensors
		* combining heterogenous contexts
			* composite
		* derive high context from low
			* time, location -> metting
		* derive low context from high
			* meeting -> time
		* creation, modification, deletion
		* security, privacy
	* Context aware adaption
		* relation of current cotnext to the goal context that is the essence
		* only those that are relevant to goal
	* Context representation
		* 6 types, key value, markup, graphical, Object oriented, logic, ontology
	* Lifecycle: 
		* Context determination
			* compute sensor into data for computation
		* user context acquisition
			* get the goal user context
		* Context processing
			* process and adapt active/passive
		* Context management
			* Store the process
	* Challenges
		* Incomplete, incorrect or imprecise -> false positive and false negatives for user contexts
* Mobility Awareness
	* Location
	* Phone
	* GPS
* Spatial Awareness
	* Location aware system
	* Passitive relative or absolute location
	* Active updated current position and routes on mpas
	* GPS, bluetooth, infrared and wifi
	* Spatation context creation
		* Lateration
			* time of right / RSSI
		* Angulation
			* Angle measurements with at least one known distance
			* aircraft Omi direction raning
		* Coordinate is not enough - need to know what is there for context
* Temporal awareness
	* Coordinating and scheduling
	* Time
	* clock synch
* ICT System awareness
	* transparent 
	* UI
	* UI adaption to context
	* QOS changes when moving
	* Service discovery
	* underlay network aware
