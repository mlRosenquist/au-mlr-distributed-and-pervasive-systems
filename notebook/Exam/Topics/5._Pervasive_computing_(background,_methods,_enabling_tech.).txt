===== Litterature =====

==== POSLAD2009 chapter 1 ====
* Smart Device
* Smart Environment
* Smart Interaction
* Ubiquity - its everywhere
* Transparent - we dont notice it is there. in interaction
* Openess - add remove systems. Complexicity and availability
* ICT - Information Communication Technology
* HCI - Human Computer Interaction
	* Implicit - Calm - 
	* Explicit - user do every action
* VR - create new world
* AR - modify existing world
* Context Awareness
	* Physical - locationg, time
	* Human: preferences, social mood
	* ICT - available services
	* Active vs Passive
	* User awareness
* Autonomy
	* Decide own actions
	* USer configures task or goals
	* Reduce human interaction
	* Mainentance, manual vs self-maintaining
* Intelligence
* Taxanomy of ubicom props
	* ubiquity and transparent
	* low power, bandiwth, embedded devices
	* dist mobile systems, intelligent systems
	* ubiquity is context driven
	* Properties of differetn systems, distributed, iHCI, context aware, autonomous, intelligent
* Ubiqutuitous systs env inter
	* infrastructe of other ICT, human environment, physical environment
* H2H, C2C, CCI, H2C, C2H, P2P 
* Architectural Design
	* Smart means: active, digital, networked, autonomously
	* Overlap
	* Smart Device
		* Smart Phone, PC
		* phone is also a camera, music player is also a printer
		* Owner
		* props: mobiity, dynamic service discovery, intermittent ressource acces
		* tabs, pads and boards
		* Wireless Networks
		* Service Discovery
		* Situated and self aware
		* May use some awareness of the physical environment
	* Smart Environment
		* React to events, and do something
		* Walls can sense camera is recording and modify lightning
		* Set of networked devices - connected to physical world
		* Single predifined task
		* Support a bounded local context of user interaction
		* focus on distributing multiple devices in the physical environments whiich are context ware of their human users and their phyiscal locality
	* Smart Interactions
		* For SD and SI to support core props of UbiCom we need smart interaction
		* Devices interoperate
		* Camera can interonnect to phone to share recording direct to printer to print
		* Basic Interaction - Sender know receiver in advance, message is aggreed, control flow is known
		* interaction that are coordinated, conventions based, semantics and lingustic based, driven by dynamic organisations
		* Sensor to turn on lights. Only turn on specific lights. Using context of location and what the person is doing. 
		* Operate more autonomously using minimal human operation management.

* Ahead of his time - 1991
* Tabs - smart phone
* Pads - tablet
* Boards - white boards
* These devices are going to be everywhere
* Wireless
* The amount of ubiqituous computing is more than traditional computing
* These smart devices can be used to build smart environments and interaction

==== ABOWD2016 full paper ====
* from ubiquitous to collective
* Goes through the three past eras: mainframe, pc, ubiqutous
* Propose collective
* Cloud: www, distributed systems, cloud computing
* Crowd: physical replacement. Peoples opinions and so forth. 
* Shroud: IoT devices. the technologies that can give info.
* We are to combine these in a collective manner, to build killer applications. 
* Example Health: Shroud has wearables and different devices to retrive data from people. Crowd has specialiced people that can come with inpu on diagnosis. Cloud can do machine learning on the data. 
* We dont care if the decision comes from cloud or crowd. 
* The three work together to get a better result.
