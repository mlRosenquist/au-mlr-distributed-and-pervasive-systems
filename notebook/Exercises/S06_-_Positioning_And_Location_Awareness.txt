====== S06 - Positioning And Location Awareness ======


===== 1. Exercise: Location based services =====

==== What is a location based service? ====

==== Why is geographical position data relevant for location based services? ====

==== Discuss some of the common location based services you know ====

=== Discuss some of the common location based services you know ===

=== What level of position accuracy is required for those services to work (will that include/exclude some sensor or network technologies)? ===

=== Does those services collect and use location data for anything other than rendering the particular service (e.g. for adds or other third-party purposes)? ===
